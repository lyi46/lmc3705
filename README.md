For this project, our team conducted an on-site observational study of the Georgia Tech Library. Over the course of several days, we collected multiple data entries per day by physically walking through the library and counting usage patterns across floors, zones, and time periods. Our dataset includes variables such as crowd levels, noise, seating availability, types of activities, and environmental conditions—captured consistently using our shared spreadsheet.

While the data quality is solid for an observational study, we recognize that additional variables (such as noise, weather, and energy level) could have provided deeper insights. Even so, we successfully documented the major patterns that influence how students use Price Gilbert throughout the day.

Based on this shared dataset, each team member created an individual project that transforms the collected information into a unique creative or analytical outcome.

### Title: The Fortune Book of Price Gilbert
The Fortune Book of Price Gilbert is an interactive web experience inspired by our collected data on student study habits in the Georgia Tech Library. During our observation sessions, we recorded when, where, and how students used different floors and study zones—tracking patterns in noise levels, crowding, social behavior, and preferred work environments.
Using these insights, I designed a playful “fortune-telling” interface that helps students choose a study spot based on their current mood or vibe. Users select from four illustrated books, each tied to a different study preference. Behind the scenes, each book generates rotating fortunes grounded in the patterns we observed—guiding students toward realistic, data-informed study locations inside Price Gilbert.
