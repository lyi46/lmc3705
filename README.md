### Title: The Fortune Book of Price Gilbert
The Fortune Book of Price Gilbert is an interactive web experience inspired by our collected data on student study habits in the Georgia Tech Library. During our observation sessions, we recorded when, where, and how students used different floors and study zones—tracking patterns in noise levels, crowding, social behavior, and preferred work environments.
Using these insights, I designed a playful “fortune-telling” interface that helps students choose a study spot based on their current mood or vibe. Users select from four illustrated books, each tied to a different study preference (quiet deep work, social energy, cozy comfort, or adventurous exploring). Behind the scenes, each book generates rotating fortunes grounded in the patterns we observed—guiding students toward realistic, data-informed study locations inside Price Gilbert.
